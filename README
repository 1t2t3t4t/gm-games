Don't send me any bug reports right now because I know there are plenty of bugs
and plenty of features that need to be added.  However, if you are a Python
hacker who wants to work on the game, please email me.  There is a lot of work
left to be done to make this game more fun, and I can't do it all myself.

Dependencies
------------

Required packages on Ubuntu 11.04 (probably similar on other distros):

* python (i.e. Python 2, not Python 3)
* python-gtk2

I haven't tried any other platforms, but if you install the packages listed
above on Windows maybe it would work.
