This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay.

The dates are when development finished, not when the change was actually deployed to basketball-gm.com or football-gm.com.

Entries in bold are ones important enough that I would have put them in [the old changelog](./CHANGELOG-old.md).
