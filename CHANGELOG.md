This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay.

The dates are when development finished, not when the change was actually deployed to basketball-gm.com or football-gm.com.

Entries in bold are ones important enough that I would have put them in [the old changelog](./CHANGELOG-old.md).

* 2019-12-11: Added a "Budget" option to God Mode, which lets you equalize all the team spending effects (scouting, coaching, facilities, health) and ignore whether your team is making a profit or loss.
